  // can also install whatever React hooks you need here to manage state or
  // fetch data.
  //
  // Props you can pass into PlasmicDynamicPage are:
  // 1. Variants you want to activate,
  // 2. Contents for slots you want to fill,
  // 3. Overrides for any named node in the component to attach behavior and data,
  // 4. Props to set on the root node.
  //
  // By default, PlasmicDynamicPage is wrapped by your project's global
  // variant context providers. These wrappers may be moved to
  // Gatsby "wrapRootElement" function
  // (https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/reference/config-files/gatsby-ssr#wrapRootElement).
