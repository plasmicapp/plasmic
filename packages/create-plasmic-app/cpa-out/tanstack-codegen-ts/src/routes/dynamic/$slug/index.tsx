  // 1. Variants you want to activate,
  // 2. Contents for slots you want to fill,
  // 3. Overrides for any named node in the component to attach behavior and data,

  // variant context providers. These wrappers may be moved to
  // TanStack Router __root Route
  // (https://tanstack.com/router/latest/docs/framework/react/guide/tanstack-start#the-root-of-your-application).
