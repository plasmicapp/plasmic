# Developing Plasmic Studio: getting started

## Machine Setup

### OS-specific instructions

#### Mac OS X

Update the version numbers for Postgresql in the following depending on what's latest!

```
{ sed 's/#.*//' | while read line; do sudo port install -b $line; done ; } << "EOF"
curl-ca-bundle
postgresql15
postgresql15-server
hadolint # for Dockerfile checking
EOF

# Follow the instructions printed during the postgresql-server installation:
sudo port select postgresql postgresql15
sudo mkdir -p /opt/local/var/db/postgresql15/defaultdb
sudo chown postgres:postgres /opt/local/var/db/postgresql15/defaultdb
sudo su postgres -c 'cd /opt/local/var/db/postgresql15 && /opt/local/lib/postgresql15/bin/initdb -D /opt/local/var/db/postgresql15/defaultdb
sudo port load postgresql15-server
```

(Your life will be much easier if you use macports. Don't use brew for installing PG.)

In order for `sudo -u postgres psql` to work without error messages, you should `chmod 755 ~`.

#### Ubuntu 18.04+

- Install OS packages:

  ```
  apt update
  apt install build-essential python3 python3-pip virtualenvwrapper postgresql postgresql-contrib wget screen
  ```

- You may also need to increase your max watched file limit (see [issue](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/issues/2549)):
  ```
  echo fs.inotify.max_user_watches=524288 | sudo tee -a /etc/sysctl.conf && sudo sysctl -p
  ```

### asdf

`asdf` (https://asdf-vm.com/) manages multiple versions of runtimes/tools that we use, such as `node` and `python`.
This can be useful if you need to work in multiple environments on the same machine.

Versions are kept in version control in `.tool-versions` and `.envrc`.

1. Install `asdf`: https://asdf-vm.com/guide/getting-started.html
1. Install plugins:
   ```
   asdf plugin add nodejs
   asdf plugin add python
   asdf plugin add direnv
   ```
1. Run `asdf install` from the root directory (and any dir with `.tool-versions`).
1. In the root directory, run: `direnv allow`.
1. Check that the installed tools work and have the correct version.
   ```bash
   node --version
   python --version
   ```

Notes:

- You want asdf for python instead of using your Mac's system python because
  - in the latest MacOS 12.6 (which suddenly switches to python 3.9) building binary packages within certain environments like the pre-commit pyenv is broken, unless maybe you install Xcode.
  - we have more consistent control across platforms of which python we are relying on, which can have subtle effects on the chances of success of npm gyp builds. Plus, no more sudden switching python 3.8 to 3.9 (for ex) just because you updated MacOS!
- You want asdf-direnv so that:
  - you get local virtualenv's managed by direnv (what's called "layouts" in direnv) - these local envs are not handled by asdf.
  - things like `node --various-node-flags $(which yarn)` work as expected (used in various scripts).
  - plus the general benefits of avoiding shims.

### Docker (unmaintained)

By default, the code repo directory is mounted as a shared volume with the host.

First navigate to your `plasmic` repo root and run:

```
bash ./wab/tools/docker-dev/docker-start.bash
```

It will print out further instructions on activating your nodeenv, setting up the database, and running servers.

## Git Setup

- Make sure you have installed the git hooks by running the following in the project root dir.

  ```
  bash ./first_time_setup.sh
  ```

- Make sure you pull in submodules, for the react-scripts infrastructure:

  ```
  git submodule update --init --recursive
  ```

- Set this flag to ensure normal operations like `git pull` also update your submodules, so you don't need to always run `git submodule update`:

  ```
  git config submodule.recurse true
  ```

### Internal team git setup for Gerrit

- In case your default linux/mac user is different from your gerrit user name, add the following to your `~/.ssh/config` file:

  ```
  # Gerrit account
  Host gerrit.aws.plasmic.app
    HostName gerrit.aws.plasmic.app
    User GERRIT_USER
    IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_rsa
  ```

  **NOTE**: To get the above config to work, you need to add your public SSH key to Gerrit user settings, if you haven't already:

  - Ensure you have an `~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub`. If it does not already exist, you can create it by running the following command on your terminal:

  ```
  ssh-keygen -t rsa -C "your_email@mail.com"
  ```

  This will create a private `~/.ssh/id_rsa` and a public key `~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub`.

  - Go to Gerrit's SSH Keys section in User Settings.
  - Paste the contents of the public key `~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub` into the New SSH Key text box.
  - Click the 'ADD NEW SSH KEY' button.

- Make sure you also have the gerrit commit-msg hook installed on this project, if you haven't already.

  NOTE: Add a missing -O flag! On newer ssh/macos, the default command for gerrit will fail otherwise. More background here: https://bugs.chromium.org/p/gerrit/issues/detail?id=15944

  ```
  scp -O -p -P 29418 USER@gerrit.aws.plasmic.app:hooks/commit-msg ".git/hooks/"
  ```

- Also install this on the submodule dir (wab/create-react-app-new), which requires running:

  ```
  scp -O -p -P 29418 USER@gerrit.aws.plasmic.app:hooks/commit-msg ".git/modules/wab/create-react-app-new/hooks/"
  ```

## Application setup

In the project root directory, run:

```
yarn bootstrap
```

## Starting dev servers

Run all servers in GNU screens:

```
yarn dev
```

## Using the app

The app runs on http://localhost:3003/ and the admin server sits at http://localhost:3003/admin .

If you have freshly reset the DB, the following users will be created for you
(see [seed script](/platform/wab/src/wab/server/db/DbInit.ts) for details):

- admin@admin.example.com
- user@example.com
- user2@example.com

The password for these accounts is `!53kr3tz!`.

WARNING: Avoid testing with the admin@admin.example.com user.
By default, the admin.example.com domain is considered an admin and has
elevated privileges (e.g. access to all teams, workspaces, projects, etc).
For most development purposes, use a normal user such as user@example.com.
