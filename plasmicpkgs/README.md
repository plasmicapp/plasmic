# plasmicpkgs

`plasmicpkgs` are shared packages that allow using custom code (e.g. components, functions, and more) directly in Plasmic.

## Development

Development of plasmicpkgs requires an [app host](https://docs.plasmic.app/learn/app-hosting/) for testing and development. You can use the app host at [plasmicpkgs-dev](../plasmicpkgs-dev), which conveniently alters names so they don't conflict with production names.

## Testing

Please set up Storybook tests. Refer to the [react-aria](./react-aria) package as a reference.
