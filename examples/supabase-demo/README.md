# Plasmic+Supabase Blog Demo
This is a demo of building a blog on top of Plasmic (for frontend), Supabase (for backend), and Next.js (platform). To read more about how this works, check out our blog post
[here]().

## Getting Started

1. Copy `.env.example` to `.env.local` and populate your Supabase credentials.
The blog post above will show you how to properly set up a compatible Supabase project.

2. Run the development server:

```bash
yarn dev
```

3. Open your browser to see the result.

4. You can view the Plasmic-built frontend [here](https://studio.plasmic.app/projects/i6YZmFxPJB69NEUgdf79ap). If you want to make edits, clone the Plasmic project and note the new
project ID and token. These fields will need to be updated in `.env.local` to reflect your changes.

## Learn More

With Plasmic, you can enable non-developers on your team to publish pages and content into your website or app.
