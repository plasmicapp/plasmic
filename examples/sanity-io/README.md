# Sanity integration with Plasmic

Note that there is now a more up-to-date, built-in version of this in Plasmic, and its source lives in the `plasmicpkgs` directory.
But this project still serves as a simple example of how to make simple [data-fetching code components](https://docs.plasmic.app/learn/data-code-components).

This is a Next.js project bootstrapped with [`create-plasmic-app`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-plasmic-app).

It includes a couple of code components:

- SanityFetcher, which fetches Sanity data by GROQ and repeats some elements
- SanityField, which renders a specific text or image field

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
yarn dev
```

Then open the corresponding Plasmic project (cloning it if you wish):

https://studio.plasmic.app/projects/KvH4HMs91XCoTmeRY5e5v

You can start editing your project in Plasmic Studio.
